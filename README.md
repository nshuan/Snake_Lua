# Snake

### Description

The game is written with Lua and Love 2D.

The reason why I decided to try this language is Balatro, of course.

## Features

One tiny feature of the project is that I used procedural animation for simulating the snake's nodes movement.

## Installation

Download and install Love 2D from [this website](https://love2d.org/#download).

For easiest way to run the project, find the directory where Love 2D icon stands and drag the project folder into that icon (makes sure that the the main.lua is in the root of the project folder).
